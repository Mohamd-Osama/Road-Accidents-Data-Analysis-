# 🚗 Road Accidents Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an extensive analysis of road accident data to identify key causes, temporal trends, and safety insights. [cite_start]The goal was to understand factors contributing to fatalities and injuries—such as driver behavior, weather conditions, and regional differences—to recommend actionable safety improvements[cite: 54].

## 📊 Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Geographical Analysis 🌍
* [cite_start]**Regional Injuries:** North America leads with **252.9K** injuries, closely followed by Australia (**252.4K**) and Europe (**252.0K**)[cite: 72, 73].
* [cite_start]**Country Hotspots:** Brazil, Germany, and Australia each exceed **126K injuries**[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**Lowest Injuries:** Russia recorded the lowest injury numbers among the analyzed countries[cite: 65, 70].
* [cite_start]**Correlation:** There is a strong correlation between high injury rates and high fatality rates in these regions[cite: 74].

### 2. Temporal Trends ⏳
* [cite_start]**Yearly Pattern:** Injury numbers have remained steady since 2000 (fluctuating between 49K-51K/year), and fatalities have consistently hovered around **10K/year**[cite: 87, 88].
* **Time of Day:**
    * [cite_start]**Fatalities:** Peak during **Night, Evening, and Morning** (approx. 60K each)[cite: 90].
    * [cite_start]**Traffic Volume:** Highest in the **Afternoon and Morning** (~5,000 vehicles)[cite: 81].
* [cite_start]**Seasonality:** Accidents occur consistently across all months (20K-26K vehicles involved), with slight increases in **June, April, and May**[cite: 105, 106].

### 3. Driver & Vehicle Insights 🚘
* [cite_start]**Driver Fatigue:** A critical factor contributing to **50.15%** of fatalities (132K cases)[cite: 98].
* [cite_start]**Age Groups:** Drivers **under 18** show the highest involvement in cyclist-related accidents, followed by the 18-25 age group[cite: 94].
* [cite_start]**Vehicle Condition:** Fatalities are evenly distributed across vehicle conditions (Good: 33.21%, Moderate: 33.42%, Poor: 33.37%), suggesting vehicle condition alone is not the primary factor[cite: 109, 110, 111, 112].

### 4. Weather & Road Conditions 🌧️
* [cite_start]**High Risk Conditions:** **Wet and snow-covered roads** have the highest injury rates (314K-317K injuries)[cite: 120].
* [cite_start]**Dangerous Weather:** **Rainy conditions** contribute most to accidents across all road types[cite: 128, 130].
* [cite_start]**Traffic Volume:** Windy and rainy conditions see the highest average traffic volumes (>5,000 vehicles), increasing risk[cite: 84].
* **Visibility:** Foggy and snowy conditions significantly reduce visibility levels to approx. [cite_start]272-274[cite: 210].

### 5. Economic & Medical Impact 💰
* [cite_start]**Cost Distribution:** Across all regions, **Economic Loss** accounts for ~66% and **Medical Costs** for ~33% of the total burden[cite: 181, 182].
* [cite_start]**Top Country:** **Canada** ranks highest in total economic loss and medical expenses[cite: 187].
* [cite_start]**Insurance Claims:** Australia records the highest number of insurance claims (~120K)[cite: 193].

## 🚨 Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
1.  [cite_start]**Combat Drunk Driving & Speeding:** Implement stricter regulations, as these are leading causes of fatalities (Speeding alone caused 3,400 deaths)[cite: 147, 151, 230].
2.  [cite_start]**Fatigue Monitoring:** Introduce mandatory rest breaks for long-distance drivers and promote fatigue detection systems[cite: 115].
3.  [cite_start]**Target Young Drivers:** Launch safety awareness programs specifically for drivers **<18** regarding cyclist safety[cite: 115].
4.  [cite_start]**Emergency Response:** Improve response efficiency in high-injury regions and during morning peak hours to match afternoon levels[cite: 168, 169].
5.  [cite_start]**Infrastructure:** Improve lighting on roads to reduce night-time severity and enhance safety on wet/snowy roads[cite: 148, 213].
